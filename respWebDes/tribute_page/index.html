        (宮本 武蔵, c. 1584 – June 13, 1645), also known as Shinmen Takezō, Miyamoto Bennosuke or,
        by his Buddhist name, Niten Dōraku, was a Japanese swordsman, philosopher, writer and rōnin. Musashi,
        as he was often simply known, became renowned through stories of his excellent and unique double-bladed
        swordsmanship and <strong>undefeated record in his 61 duels</strong> (next is 33 by Itō Ittōsai). He was the founder of
        the Niten-Ichi-Ryū-School or Nito-Ichi-ryū style of swordsmanship and in his final years authored The
        Book of Five Rings (五輪の書 Go Rin No Sho), and Dokkōdō (The Path of Aloneness). Both documents were
        given to Terao Magonojō, the most important of Musashi's students, seven days before Musashi's death.
        The Book of Five Rings deals primarily with the character of his Niten-Ichi-Ryū-School in a concrete
        sense e.g. his own practical martial art and its generic significance; The Path of Aloneness on the
        other hand, deals with the ideas that lie behind it, as well as his life's philosophy in a few short
        aphoristic sentences.
